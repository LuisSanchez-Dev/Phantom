Phantom is a lightweight, simple (but not minimalistic) native markdown editor for Windows written in C# and WPF.

Why?
======
Markdown editors for Windows desktop aren't great.  
I confidently say this because of the latest "make everything in a web browser!" phase of software, most MD editors are slow and look terribly and perform even more terribly.

Downloads
======
I currently officially host Phantom on my own website.  You can download it [here](https://vaporsoft.net/phantom/)
